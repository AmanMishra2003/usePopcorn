Component Categories
three Categories
1. Stateless / presentational Components
2. Statefull Components
3. Structural Components

**---Component Composition---** Technique to combine different component using children prop
as we studied we can put component inside a component 

************
<model/>
inside model
function model(){
    return (
        <succes/>
    )
}
***********

In this form it creates a problem where we cannot easily use model component and success component is tightly bind to the model component

We can refactor this into a model resusable and diff component

************
inside model
function model({children}){
    return (
        {children}
    )
}

<model>
    <success/>
</model>
***********

now using success component as a child of model component we can reuse model component more easily.

Problem solve by Component Composition
1. Solve Prop drilling problem
2. Create hightly reusable and flexible component
